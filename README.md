**rshell:**

This project, formally and informally known as rshell, is programmed in the C++
programming language and functions as a command shell.

**Introduction:**

rshell simulates a terminal, and has most of the same functionality. As of
right now, rshell is incomplete, but will be as time progresses.

**Installation Instructions:**


    git clone https://github.com/pgior001/rshell.git

    cd rshell

    git checkout hw1

    make

    bin/rshell

**Bugs:**


1) cd is not working. This is not really a bug, but rather a flaw in execvp.
